# Example Script

Let’s break down the 1938 Orson Welles “War of the Worlds” broadcast incident into a film-style structure using:

- Sequences (broad chunks of action),

- Scenes (specific settings/events),

- Shots (camera perspectives or key narrative moments).

    - Scene 1.1: CBS Radio Studio, New York – October 30, 1938, 8:00 PM
        - Shot 1.1.1: Wide shot of a bustling studio. Welles adjusts his script, sound engineers prep.
        - Shot 1.1.2: Close-up of the radio dial: “Columbia Broadcasting System” crackles to life.
        - Shot 1.1.3: Cut to Orson Welles smirking slightly — he knows the gravity of the performance.

- Sequence 2: The Broadcast Begins
    - Scene 2.1: CBS Radio Airwaves (Diegetic Space – within the fiction of the play)
        - Shot 2.1.1: Radio plays soothing ballroom music. All is calm.
